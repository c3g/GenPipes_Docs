      GenPipes offers the CoVSeq pipeline (for short-read sequencing, e.g. Illumina) and Nanopore_CoVSeq pipeline (for long-read sequencing) to help researchers analyze viral sequences and detect mutations quickly, with the goal of preventing the spread of new strains. See :ref:`GenPipes CoVSeq Pipeline User Guide<docs_gp_covseq>`, :ref:`GenPipes Nanopore CoVSeq Pipeline User Guide<docs_gp_nanopore_cov>` for details.

Welcome onboard GenPipes!
