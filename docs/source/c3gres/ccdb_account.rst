Pre-deployed GenPipes
======================

Researchers with access to the `Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC) <https://alliancecan.ca/en>`_, formerly Canadian Center for Computational Genomics (C3G), resources can simply login and access GenPipes deployed on DRAC servers. 

If you are an external user, who does not have access to the DRAC compute resources, you can apply for your account `here <https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca>`_.  Once you have that account, you can access GenPipes pre-deployed on Alliance servers.  For details see :ref:`how to obtain an account and get started with using pre-deployed GenPipes<docs_access_gp_pre_installed>`.
