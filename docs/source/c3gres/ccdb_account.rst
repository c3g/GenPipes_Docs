GenPipes Pre-deployed on Alliance Servers
===============================================

Researchers who have access to `Digital Research Alliance of Canada <https://alliancecan.ca/en>` (formerly Compute Canada) resources do not need to deploy GenPipes for genomic analysis. They can simply login and access Alliance servers that have pre-installed stable release of GenPipes. 

If you are an external user, who does not have access to Alliance compute resources, you can apply for your CCDB account `here <https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca>`.  Once you have that account, you can access GenPipes pre-deployed on Alliance servers.  For details on how to obtain an account and get started with using pre-deployed GenPipes, see :ref:`here<docs_access_gp_pre_installed>`.
