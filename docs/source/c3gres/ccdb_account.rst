GenPipes Pre-deployed on Compute Canada Servers
===============================================

Researchers who have access to Compute Canada resources need not deploy GenPipes for genomic analysis. They can simply login and access Compute Canada servers that have pre-installed stable release of GenPipes. 

If you are an external user, who does not have access to Compute Canada data centre compute resources, you can apply for your CCDB account.  Once you have that account, you can access GenPipes pre-deployed on Compute Canada servers.  For details on how to obtain an account and get started with using pre-deployed GenPipes, see :ref:`here<docs_access_gp_pre_installed>`.
