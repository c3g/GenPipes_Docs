Error: Missing Genomes and Annotations
---------------------------------------

Several users have encountered this issue.

**Fix**

Most of the GenPipes pipeline commands require you to supply input data in the form of readsets, design files and configuration.  If a specific genome that you need to provide to the pipeline is not available in the pre-installed GenPipes setup deployed on Compute Canada servers as listed in test `datasets <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/test-dataset/>`_and available `genomes <https://genpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c3gres/cvmfs_genomes.html>`_.
