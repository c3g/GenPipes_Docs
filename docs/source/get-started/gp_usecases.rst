Following is a summary of real-life application use case for each of the GenPipes Pipelines:

RNA Sequencing
--------------

The :ref:`RNA Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_rnaseq>` helps to quantify transcripts and genes using a reference genome and test for differential expression across experimental conditions. It is also possible to call single nucleotide variants (SNVs), detect fusion gene events and assess alternative splicing events.

De Novo RNA Sequencing
-----------------------

The :ref:`De Novo RNA Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_rnaseq_denovo>` assembles reads to transcripts in the absence of a reference genome, annotates transcripts and tests for differential expression. This is well suited to organisms that are not yet characterized.

miRNA Sequencing
-----------------

This pipeline can be used to quantify known miRNAs, discovers novel ones using a reference genome and performs differential expression analysis. Additional analysis may include pathway testing, target candidates analysis or miRNA editing.

SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Pipeline
--------------------------------------

The :ref:`SARS-CoV-2 genome Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_covseq>` is designed for COVID-19 Coronavirus research and surveillance, enabling complete genome sequencing of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. 

DNA Methylation Pipeline
-------------------------

The :ref:`Methylation Pipeline<docs_methylation>` helps to analyze data coming from bisulfite converted DNA assayed by various sequencing assays such as RRBS, CpG capture, whole genome sequencing or microarrays. Our analysis computes methylation levels and performs differential analysis between experimental conditions.

HiC Pipeline
-------------

The :ref:`HiC Pipeline<docs_gp_hicseq>` offers data analysis and provides interaction matrices at several resolutions, compartment analysis, topologically associating domain (TAD) predictions, as well as significant chromosomal interactions. Further analyses may include comparisons across samples/conditions and integration of various sample data (expression data, methylation, CTCF/histone binding sites) with Hi-C data.

Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline
-----------------------------

The :ref:`Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_ampliconseq>` can process Illumina, PacBio pyrotags amplicons from the 16S, 18S or ITS amplicons. OTUs are picked and diversity is analyzed within and between communities. Further analyses include differential abundance testing or metagenome functional content prediction.

DNA Sequencing
---------------

The :ref:`DNA Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_dnaseq>` offers state of the art DNA-seq analyses detects and annotates variants in whole exomes, whole genomes or high coverage amplicons. The analysis can also be pushed further by assisting with variant prioritization, or perform advanced cancer related analysis.

ChIP Sequencing Pipeline
------------------------

The :ref:`ChIP Sequencing Pipeline<docs_gp_chipseq>` helps in analyzing DNA fragments from immunoprecipitated chromatin by calling alignment peaks on the genome, annotating the said peaks and performing additional analyses such as motif enrichment and discovery. Designed experiments can be analyzed by testing for differential binding between experimental conditions.
