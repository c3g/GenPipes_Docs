GenPipes 4.2.0 Release Notes
============================

What's new? 
-----------

* :ref:`Tumor Pair<docs_gp_tumorpair>`: fix of numerous bugs and departure from `GEMINI`_ to `PCGR`_/`CPSR`_ reporting. 

* New ini file setup with one common ini per cluster for all pipelines (found in pipeline/common_ini folder).

  .. note:: ** New .ini usage update via -c option**

       What this means is, you need to add a common ini file in addition to the base .ini file. For example:

       ::

         chipseq.py -c $MUGQIC_PIPELINES_HOME/pipelines/chipseq/chipseq.base.ini $MUGQIC_PIPELINES_HOME/pipelines/common_ini/beluga.ini -r readset.chipseq.txt -d design.chipseq.txt -s 1-20 -g chipseqScript.txt

* ChIPSeq : added variant calling using GATK4


Quick! Where can I find it? I can't wait!

Where is the detailed ChangeLog? 
================================= 
A ChangeLog (`CHANGELOG.md <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_) is available in the archive as well as in the repository.

Since we use git, there are many ways to get the details in many formats. 
One of our preferred ways is to use a script written by the author of the Ray assembler: Sébastien Boisvert, 
which lists the commits by tag and author: 

https://raw.github.com/sebhtml/ray/master/scripts/dump-ChangeLog.sh 

Enjoy our pipelines on the many clusters where they are installed!
