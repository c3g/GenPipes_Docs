GenPipes 4.6.1 Release Notes
============================

What's new? 
-----------

This is a minor release with a fix in DNASeq pipeline related to the .ini file:

* `DNA Sequencing Pipeline <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/4.6.1/pipelines/dnaseq/>`_
   - Fixed a missing key in the dnaseq.base.ini file. The error showed up when running the pipeline with the default protocol.
      
Quick! Where can I find it? I can't wait!

Where is the detailed ChangeLog? 
================================= 

A ChangeLog (`CHANGELOG.md <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_) is available in the archive as well as in the repository.

Since we use git, there are many ways to get the details in many formats.

One of our preferred ways is to use `a script <https://raw.github.com/sebhtml/ray/master/scripts/dump-ChangeLog.sh>`_ written by the author of the Ray assembler: Sébastien Boisvert, which lists the commits by tag and author. 

Enjoy our pipelines installed on the many Compute Canada clusters!
We look forward to your feedback!
