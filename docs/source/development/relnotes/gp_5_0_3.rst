Where is the detailed ChangeLog? 
================================= 

A ChangeLog (`CHANGELOG.md <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_) is available in the archive as well as in the repository.

Since we use git, there are many ways to get the details in many formats.

One of our preferred ways is to use `a script <https://raw.github.com/sebhtml/ray/master/scripts/dump-ChangeLog.sh>`_ written by the author of the Ray assembler: Sébastien Boisvert, which lists the commits by tag and author. 

We look forward to your feedback!
