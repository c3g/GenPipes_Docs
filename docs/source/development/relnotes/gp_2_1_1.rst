GenPipes 2.1.1 Release Notes
============================

A new micro release of GenPipes 2.1.1 is now available.

What's new? 
------------

* Complete report redesign! It's now easier to modify report sections, and we can build partial reports (only using a few steps). Examples of these reports will be deployed on our web site soon.
* Other than THAT, mostly bug fixes and tweaks:
    - One of these bugs was the rRNA computation using STAR. It was off because of STAR BAM handling by RNA-SeQC
* Some modules were added or were updated
* Gorilla_gorilla.gorGor3 was installed in genomes

Quick! Where can I find it? I can't wait! 
------------------------------------------

* This version tarball is in: https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/downloads/mugqic_pipelines-2.1.1.tar.gz 

Compute Canada Servers abacus, guillimin and mammouth clusters are updated with this new release.
