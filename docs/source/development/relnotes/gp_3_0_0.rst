GenPipes 3.0.0 Release Notes
============================a

A new release of the GenAP pipelines, now called GenPipes, 3.0.0 is now available.

What's new?
-----------

* New MethylSeq pipeline : DNA methylation detection for bisulfite whole genome or targeted sequencing analysis - applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides.
* New HicSeq pipeline : to analyze both Hi-C experimental and capture Hi-C data (Hi-C experiments allow researchers to understand chromosomal folding and structure using proximity ligation techniques)
* New RNA-Seq Light pipeline : quick and accurate transcript-level expression quantification and exploratory analysis
* Now each pipeline execution creates a JSON analysis file per analyzed sample in order to be able to monitor each sample analysis
* Added a new pipeline specific argument : protocol - this allows to execute a specific set of steps for a pipeline depending on the chosen protocol ; initially developed for HiC-Seq pipeline, will be progressively deployed to all the other pipelines
* Bug fixes
* Some modules were added/updated
* A new genome was installed :
    - Apis_mellifera.Amel_4.5

Quick! Where can I find it? I can't wait!
