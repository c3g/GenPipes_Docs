Deploying GenPipes in the cloud
=================================

.. note::
   
        Currently, GenPipes can only be deployed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
        Later, once it is supported for other clouds, requisite instructions will be updated here.

This document describes how to deploy GenPipes in the cloud using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). For more details on other available options to deploy and access GenPipes you may refer to :ref:`GenPipes Deployment Options Page<docs_dep_options>`.

TBD - Need more insights than what is provided in `GenPipes in the Cloud README.md file` <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/cloud_deplyoment/src/master/>`_.
