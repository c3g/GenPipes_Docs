Deploying GenPipes
===================

This document lists various ways by which GenPipes can be accessed and installed by users. Check out various :ref:`available deployment options<docs_dep_options>`, if you wish to install and setup GenPipes on your infrastructure.  If you wish to use pre-installed GenPipes deployed on Compute Canada infrastructure, refer to :ref:`Accessing GenPipes on Digital Research Alliance Canada servers<docs_access_gp_pre_installed>`. 

.. note::
   **Do you need help choosing which deployment option to use?**
      We've developed a helpful tool: the :ref:`GenPipes Wizard <docs_gp_wizard>`. It guides users through selecting the appropriate deployment method, pipeline, and protocol, and helps construct the full command to run GenPipes.
