	abstract = {With the decreasing cost of sequencing and the rapid developments in genomics technologies and protocols, the need for validated bioinformatics software that enables efficient large-scale data processing is growing. Here we present GenPipes, a flexible Python-based framework that facilitates the development and deployment of multi-step workflows optimized for High Performance Computing clusters and the cloud. GenPipes already implements 12 validated and scalable pipelines for various genomics applications, including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, DNA-Seq, Methyl-Seq, Hi-C, capture Hi-C, metagenomics and PacBio long read assembly. The software is available under a GPLv3 open source license and is continuously updated to follow recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics. The framework has been already configured on several servers and a docker image is also available to facilitate additional installations. In summary, GenPipes offers genomic researchers a simple method to analyze different types of data, customizable to their needs and resources, as well as the flexibility to create their own workflows.},
