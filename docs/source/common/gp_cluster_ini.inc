.. tip::

     Replace ``beluga.ini`` file name in the command above with the appropriate *clustername.ini* file located in the ``$MUGQIC_PIPELINES_HOME/pipelines/common_ini`` folder, depending upon the cluster where you are executing the pipeline.  For e.g., ``narval.ini``, ``cedar.ini``, ``graham.ini`` or ``narval.ini``.
