.. tip::

     Depending upon the cluster where you are executing the pipeline, substitute the file name |key_ccdb_server_ini_name| in the command with the appropriate ``<DRAC server cluster name>.ini`` file located in the ``$GENPIPES_INIS/common_ini`` folder.  
     
     For e.g., ``rorqual.ini``, ``fir.ini``, or ``narval.ini``.
