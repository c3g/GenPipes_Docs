.. tip::

     Depending upon the cluster where you are executing the pipeline, substitute the ``beluga.ini`` file name in the command with the appropriate *clustername.ini* file located in the ``$GENPIPES_INIS/common_ini`` folder.  
     
     For e.g., ``narval.ini``, ``cedar.ini``, or ``graham.ini``.
