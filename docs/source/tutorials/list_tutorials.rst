GenPipes is a flexible Python-based framework that facilitates the development and deployment of multi-step genomic workflows, optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and the cloud.  It offers open sourced, several validated and scalable pipelines for various genomics applications.

There are multiple ways to deploy and run GenPipes. For details, see :ref:`GenPipes Deployment Guide<docs_dep_options>`.

.. note::
   **Have you tried the GenPipes Wizard?**
      We've developed a helpful tool: the :ref:`GenPipes Wizard <docs_gp_wizard>`. It guides users through selecting the appropriate deployment method, pipeline, and protocol, and helps construct the full command to run GenPipes.

The GenPipes tutorials listed below demonstrate how GenPipes can be deployed and run for first time users.  Please note that the tutorials correspond to the GenPipes deployment :ref:`type<docs_dep_options>`.  If you are deploying GenPipes on the cloud, then refer to the *GenPipes in the Cloud* tutorial below.  Use the first tutorial listed below if you are accessing GenPipes pre-deployed on the `Digital Research Alliance of Canada <https://alliancecan.ca/en>`_,formerly Compute Canada, servers.
