GenPipes Tutorials
===================

GenPipes is a flexible Python-based framework that facilitates the development and deployment of multi-step genomic workflows, optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and the cloud.  It offers open sourced, several validated and scalable pipelines for various genomics applications.

There are multiple ways to deploy and run GenPipes. For details, see :ref:`GenPipes Deployment Guide<docs_dep_options>`.

The GenPipes tutorials listed below demonstrate how GenPipes can be deployed and run for first time users.  Please note that the tutorials correspond to the GenPipes deployment :ref:`type<docs_dep_options>`.  If you are deploying GenPipes on the cloud, then refer to the *GenPipes in the Cloud* tutorial below.  If you are accessing GenPipes which is pre-deployed on `Digital Research Alliance of Canada <https://alliancecan.ca/en>`_ (formerly Compute Canada) servers, use the first tutorial listed below:
