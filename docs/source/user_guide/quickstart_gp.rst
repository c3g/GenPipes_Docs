*Options marked* :bdg-info:`*` *require you to download* :ref:`GenPipes software packages<docs_get_gp>`, *or build them locally for deployment.*

* :bdg-dark-line:`Step 4: Review pipeline options`

   Check out the :ref:`available pipelines<docs_available_pipelines>`, use the :ref:`Pipeline Reference<docs_pipeline_ref>` and select an appropriate protocol for genomic analysis. Try the :ref:`GenPipes Wizard <docs_gp_wizard>` tool to select a GenPipes deployment type, pipeline, and protocol, and construct the full GenPipes command to run the analysis.

* :bdg-dark-line:`Step 5: Run GenPipes`

   Once you have the pipeline command ready with required protocol options,  :ref:`run GenPipes<docs_run_gp>` and :ref:`analyze the results<docs_gp_job_results>`. Check out the :ref:`GenPipes Tutorials<doc_list_tutorials>` for details.
