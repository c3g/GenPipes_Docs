GenPipes Documentation Map
==========================

GenPipes has several documents to help users. This document describes how GenPipes documentation is laid out and organized to assist the user, be it a new GenPipes user or a seasoned one, as well as documentation contributor (technical writer, content developer, author) point of view. 

If you are a GenPipes user, refer to the User's map below that will help you know where to look for things.  For documentation contributors there is a separate map which provides a high level overview of how the content sources are organized and find your way to editing or updating them for the end user.
