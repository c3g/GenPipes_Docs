About this documentation
=========================

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited, and revamped by
members of the GenPipes community. It is edited via text files in the
`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the
open source `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.
