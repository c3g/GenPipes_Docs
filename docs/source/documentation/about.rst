About Docs
==========

This GenPipes documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited, and revamped by
members of the GenPipes community. 

It is edited via text files in the
`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the
open-source `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.

You may also want to refer to the :ref:`GenPipes New Documentation Architecture Map<docs_genpipes_archmap>` for more insights on how GenPipes documentation is organized.
