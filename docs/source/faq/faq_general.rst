What is GenPipes?
+++++++++++++++++

GenPipes is an open source python framework for large scale genomics analysis. Refer to :ref:`What is GenPipes section<what_is_gp>` in GenPipes documentation for details.

Where can I find GenPipes Citation reference and text?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Refer to :ref:`GenPipes Citation<docs_citation>` for citing and example text for GenPipes Citation.

Where can I access latest GenPipes source code?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See :ref:`Download GenPipes<docs_download_gp_src>` section of :ref:`docs_dep_gp_local` documentation.

Do I need to deploy GenPipes locally on a server or in the cloud to use it?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You do not need to necessarily deploy GenPipes to use it.  You can use pre-installed GenPipes on Compute Canada servers. For that you need to have CCDB account. See :ref:`docs_access_gp_pre_installed` for details. If you wish to deploy GenPipes locally on your server (bare metal or virtual) or within a container, check out :ref:`GenPipes Deployment and Access Guide<docs_dep_options>` for various deployment options and how to setup and access GenPipes.

GenPipes requires familiarity with Unix. As a Windows user, what do I need to setup to use GenPipes?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are a Windows user, you need to get a working Unix command line interface to start using GenPipes.  Windows users have three main options to get a working Unix command line:

- Ubuntu on Windows (only available on Windows 10)
- Cygwin
- PuTTY

Also, if you plan to run genomics pipelines, you need a genomics data viewer such as `Integrative Genomics Viewer <https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/>`_, a graphical, high-performance visualization tool for genomics data. For details, refer to `instructions to setup your windows laptop <https://c3g.github.io/workshops/rnaseq_jan2019/C3GAW_install_software.html>`_.

Where do I find tips on troubleshooting GenPipes runtime and usage issues?
