A new developer trying to setup and run GenPipes tests found the following issues:

::

  I am trying to run some python test cases using "pytest" on beluga cluster. 
  I am running into "pytest command not found " error.

::

  I googled that error and found that it might be due to older version of setup tools.
  I tried to upgrade it and I'm seeing this error now.

**Response** 

Once your account is activated, you can login in CCDB servers such as Beluga, Cedar, Niagra.  However, these are National Systems on a shared grid and users don't have permission to install or upgrade the software there.

For more information on what software is installed on Compute Canada infrastructure, refer to `https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Available_software <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Available_software>`_.

What kind of further analysis be done using `HiC sequencing Pipeline <https://genpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/pipelines/gp_hicseq.html>`_?

**Response**

GenPipes `Real Life Applications <https://genpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/gp_usecases.html>`_ section of the documentation states that the Hi-C pipelineâ€™s further analyses may integrate ChIP-seq/RNA-seq data. Refer to the :ref:`Bait Intersect<Bait Intersect>` and :ref:`Capture Intersect<Capture Intersect>` steps of the pipeline. These steps help to integrate CHiP-seq / RNA-seq data. You can see which of your regions have CHiP-seq or RNA-seq signal.
