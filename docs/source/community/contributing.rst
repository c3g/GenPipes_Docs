Contribution
=============

The GenPipes team at C3G welcomes all contributions from the open source community!

You can contribute to GenPipes through pipeline usage, source code enhancements or documentation feedback and fixes.

#. *GenPipes Usage:* Share your GenPipes usage feedback be it pipeline usage, new feature request or if you find anything amiss at runtime.
#. *Documentation Usage:* Let us know if you are not able to find what you are looking for in GenPipes documentation or if some information is missing.

You can submit your feedback and inputs through GitHub issues. If you are a genomics developer or Sphinx documentation developer, share your pipeline and docs code fixes, enhancements through forks and GitHub pull requests. We have separate GitHub repositories that contain the pipeline and docs source code. See details on how to :ref:`get involved with GenPipes<docs_get_involved>`.
