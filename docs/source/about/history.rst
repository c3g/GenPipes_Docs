History
========

GenPipes project evolved from the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre (MUGQIC) genomic analysis project called MUGQIC Pipelines. The centre focuses on genomics applied to populations and its impact on chronic diseases, aging, cancer and genomic responses to environment.

GenPipes is the result of the centre's initiative to develop frameworks that can be used for whole-genome sequencing, as the primary tool to perform genetic analyses in humans and other species.

The following figure shows how GenPipes has evolved over the years, key releases in its evolutionary timeline and the upcoming new features under development. It also shows how the framework itself has grown from supporting only a few pipelines at the start to 14+ genomic analysis pipelines.  The number of GenPipes runs utilizing C3G HPC resources have grown significantly as well. Since the release of version 2.0.0 in 2014, a community of users has run GenPipes to conduct approximately 3,000 analyses processing ∼100,000 samples. 

The status of the repository is also indicated in terms of active branches, forks, contributors and total downloads of the open source.
