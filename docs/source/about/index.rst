About
=====

GenPipes is an open source Python-based Workflow Management System (WMS) for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genomics pipeline development. 

As part of its implementation, GenPipes includes a set of high-quality, standardized analysis pipelines, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) resources and cloud environments.

GenPipes pipelines have been tested, continuously improved through industry standard benchmarks, and used extensively over the past 4 years. By combining both WMS and extensively validated end-to-end genomic analysis workflows, into a simple tool, GenPipes not only enables bioinformatics professionals but also students, researchers in need of bioinformatics tools to perform turnkey analyses for a wide range of bioinformatics applications in the genomics field. It also allows flexible and robust extensions for advanced genomics research.
