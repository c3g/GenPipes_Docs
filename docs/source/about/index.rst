About
=====

GenPipes is an open source Python-based Workflow Management System (WMS) for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genomics pipeline development. As part of its implementation, GenPipes includes a set of high-quality, standardized analysis pipelines, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) resources and cloud environments. GenPipesâ€™ WMS and pipelines have been tested, continuously improved through industry standard benchmarks, and used extensively over the past 4 years. 
By combining both WMS and extensively validated end-to-end genomic analysis workflows, GenPipes enables bioinformatics researchers to perform turnkey analyses for a wide range of bioinformatics applications in the genomics field while also enabling flexible and robust extensions.
