About
=====

GenPipes is an open source Python-based Workflow Management System (WMS) for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genomics pipeline development. 

As part of its implementation, GenPipes includes a set of high-quality, standardized analysis pipelines, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) resources and cloud environments.

GenPipes pipelines have been tested, continuously improved through industry standard benchmarks, and used extensively over the past 4 years. By combining both WMS and extensively validated end-to-end genomic analysis workflows, into a simple tool, GenPipes not only enables bioinformatics professionals but also students, researchers in need of bioinformatics tools to perform turnkey analyses for a wide range of bioinformatics applications in the genomics field. It also allows flexible and robust extensions for advanced genomics research.

You can learn more about GenPipes, its target audience, sponsors, how the project has evolved over the years and `license <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/master/COPYING.LESSER>`_ information in the following section.
