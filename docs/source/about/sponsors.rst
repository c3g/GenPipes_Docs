C3G provides bioinformatics analysis and HPC services for the life science research community. It has created a distributed innovation node with broad expertise in bioinformatics, providing customized and case-by-case analysis services as well as an extensive suite of software solutions for the genomics community. 

About C3G
---------

C3G is an academically-affiliated entity that provides bioinformatics analysis and HPC services for the life science research community. Main objectives of C3G are:

#. Writing Open Source software to facilitate bioinformatics analysis. See `here <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/tools/>`_ for details.
#. Providing `data analysis services <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/services/>`_ to the genomics community.
#. Training graduate students and researchers through `bioinformatics workshops <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/2019-2/>`_.
#. Providing support for large scale genomics projects like `IHEC <http://ihec-epigenomes.org/>`_, `BRIDGET <https://bridget.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_.

You can learn more `about C3G <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/about/>`_ and their `partners <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/partners/>`_ on the `website <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/>`_.
