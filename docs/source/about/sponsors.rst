Sponsors
=========

The `Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics (C3G) <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca>`_ sponsors the development of GenPipes.

C3G Platform
-------------

C3G is core platform affiliated with `McGill University <https://www.mcgill.ca>`_ and `The Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Institute of Genomic Medicine <https://genomic.medicine.mcgill.ca>`_. 

The main objectives of C3G are:

#. Developing Open-Source software to facilitate bioinformatics analysis. See `here <https://computationalgenomics.ca/projects/>`_ for details.
#. Providing `analysis services <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/services/>`_ to the genomics community.
#. Training graduate students and researchers through `bioinformatics workshops <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/2019-2/>`_ and `internships <https://computationalgenomics.ca/careers-internships/summer-internships-2024/>`_.
#. Providing support for large scale genomics projects like `CanCOGeN <https://genomecanada.ca/challenge-areas/cancogen/>`_, `Terry Fox Research Institute's Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network <https://www.marathonofhopecancercentres.ca>`_, `IHEC <https://ihec-epigenomes.org/>`_, and `BRIDGET <https://bridget.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_, among others.

You can learn more `about C3G <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/about/>`_ and their `partners <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/partners/>`_ on the `website <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/>`_.
