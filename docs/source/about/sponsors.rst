GenPipes is developed by the `Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics (C3G) <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca>`_. It offers genomic researchers a simple method to analyze different types of data, customizable to their needs and resources, as well as the flexibility to create their own workflows.

C3G is a core platform affiliated with McGill University, with broad expertise in bioinformatics. It offers bioinformatics analysis and HPC services for the life sciences research community. Our services include bespoke pipeline development, service for a fee analyses, as well as an extensive suite of software solutions in the -omics fields. GenPipes is our open-source workflow and pipeline platform. 

About C3G
---------

C3G is core platform affiliated with `McGill University <https://www.mcgill.ca>`_ and `The Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Institute of Genomic Medicine <https://genomic.medicine.mcgill.ca>`_. The main objectives of C3G are:

#. Developing Open-Source software to facilitate bioinformatics analysis. See `here <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/tools/>`_ for details.
#. Providing `analysis services <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/services/>`_ to the genomics community.
#. Training graduate students and researchers through `bioinformatics workshops <https://www.computationalgenomics.ca/2019-2/>`_ and `internships <https://computationalgenomics.ca/careers-internships/summer-internships-2024/>`_.
#. Providing support for large scale genomics projects like `CanCOGeN <https://genomecanada.ca/challenge-areas/cancogen/>`_, `Terry Fox Research Institute's Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network <https://www.marathonofhopecancercentres.ca>`_, `IHEC <http://ihec-epigenomes.org/>`_, and `BRIDGET <https://bridget.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_, among others.
